## Tool Description
workflow system for network analysis. 

High level ‘IDE’-like tool that pulls in various plugins (maintained on GitHub) to handle the workflow of going from data-collection through to visualization. Various components could be shared and maintained as GitHub repos so that users would not require expertise in finding/coding the tools as there would be easy access to shared components. Similar to how bitrise build system works (https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib, https://www.bitrise.io/why/features/steps-and-workflows).

This is just a proof of concept taking advantage of an existing tool (bitrise) but I would like to develop a more domain-specific interface that includes visualization.
